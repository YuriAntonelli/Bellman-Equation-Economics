# Bellman-Equation-Macroeconomics
This repository contains an implementation of a Bellman equation solver for a macroeconomic model using four different methods: 
1. value function iteration
2. linear interpolation
3. policy function iteration
4. matrix computation
   
The project aims to provide various approaches to solving the Bellman equation, allowing for a comparative analysis of their efficiency and accuracy.

## Files
The repository consists of the following files:
- Problem:  This file presents the macroeconomic model and outlines the objectives of the project. It provides a comprehensive description of the problem being addressed, including the variables, equations, and assumptions.
- Solution: The "Solution" file showcases the results obtained from solving the Bellman equation using the four different methods. It includes relevant figures and explanations of the findings.
- Code: This folder contains four Python files, each representing one of the methods employed to solve the Bellman equation
